# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis Project

## Background Story

YouTube is the world's largest video streaming platform, with billions of videos consumed daily across the globe. This project aims to optimize trending video duration on YouTube by understanding the impact of likes, comments, and dislikes on video consumption. The Head of Product â€“ trending videos at YouTube has tasked us with this analysis to improve video views.

## Business Problem

YouTube's trending videos vary by location, and the impact of engagement metrics like likes, dislikes, and comments differs from country to country. Demographics play a significant role in video consumption patterns. To address this, our manager wants us to analyze how the average trending periods of videos vary across countries and examine how engagement metrics affect trending video duration.

## Dataset

We have three tables for analysis:
1. YT_trending_videos: Contains video-level information, including trending dates and metrics like comments, likes, and views.
2. YT_channel_map: Provides channel_id mapping to channel titles.
3. YT_category_map: Maps videos to categories based on their type.
