## Sales Analysis Project Overview

Welcome to the Sales Analysis Project! In this project, we will explore the data of a retail store chain called LES to gain valuable insights into their sales performance and customer behavior. To perform these analyses, we will be working with three main tables in the database:

### 1. Sales_fact
This table contains detailed data at the customer-transaction-product level, providing essential information about sales transactions.

### 2. Category_dim
The Category_dim table serves as a crucial resource for mapping products to their respective categories and sub-categories.

### 3. Geography_dim
Geography_dim is another significant table in our database, which helps us map store locations to specific cities, states, and countries.

**Important Note:** The "Priceusd" column in the dataset represents values in Indian Rupees (INR).

Let's proceed to break down the project into individual tasks and questions to uncover meaningful insights from the data. Enjoy the journey of data analysis and exploration!
